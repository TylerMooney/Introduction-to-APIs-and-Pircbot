# Introduction-to-APIs-and-Pircbot
A project from my CS 2336 class about APIs and Pircbot
## Details
A project from my CS 2336 - Computer Science II Class at the University of Texas at Dallas.

The first part of project goes over what RESTFUL APIs are, what a JSON is, what GSON is, and then implementation of APIs.
The second part of the project goes over what Pircbot is and then implementation of Pircbot.

The APIs I used were a weather API from OpenWeatherMap and a Marvel API from Marvel Developer Portal.
I used gson-2.6.2.jar and and pircbot.jar

You will need to request apikeys from OpenWeatherMap and Marvel Developer Portal for the API files to work.
